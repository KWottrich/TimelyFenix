# TimelyFenix
A ConnectIQ watchface inspired by [PebbleTimely](https://github.com/cynorg/PebbleTimely). Currently only supports round devices with a screen resolution between 240x240 and 280x280. Support for other watch models may be added in the future (PRs welcome).

### Features
- Weather provided by Garmin API (low battery consumption, no other permissions required)
- Calendar shows current, previous, and next week
- Buffered rendering for battery efficiency (only updates the screen when a UI element changes)

Weather icons are provided by [Pixeden](https://www.pixeden.com/icon-fonts/the-icons-font-set-weather)
