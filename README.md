# TimelyFenix
A ConnectIQ watchface inspired by [PebbleTimely](https://github.com/cynorg/PebbleTimely), with a focus on simple watch functions and a clean layout by eschewing fitness and HR tracking functions.

Supports round devices compatible with SDK 3 with a screen resolution between 240x240 and 280x280. Support for other watch models may be added in the future.(PRs welcome).
